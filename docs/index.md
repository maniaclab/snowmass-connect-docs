# Overview

The purpose of this site is to facilitate researchers in the use of the Snowmass21 Connect service in support of the [Snowmass2021 effort](https://snowmass21.org/).
As a user you have access to the following services:

* A gateway to the [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/). You can submit jobs to the OSG in order to run and scale computational workflows across the nationally distributed High ThroughPut Computing resource.
* Access to storage. You can stage input files and collect output from your jobs.
* An environment for the development of OSG appropriate workflows.
* Access to installed software and the means to make them available on the grid.
* A local computing platform for non-grid interactive jobs to either test code or analyse data.
