# Service Description

The purpose of this site is to facilitate researchers in the use of the Snowmass21 Connect service in support of the [Snowmass21 effort](https://snowmass21.org/). The information included here describes the means for the users in accessing the Snowmass21 Connect resource, the installed software, management of data and to provide material on running jobs on the Open Science Grid (OSG). 

The Snowmass21 Connect service consists of the following components:

1. Provide users a gateway to the Open Science Grid. Users can submit jobs to the OSG in order to run and scale computational workflows acroos the nationally distributed High ThroughPut Computing resource.
2. Provide access to storage where users can stage input files and collect output from their jobs
3. Provide an environment for the development of OSG appropriate workflows
4. Provide access to installed software and the means to make them available on the grid.
5. Provide a local computing platform for non-grid interactive jobs to either test code or analyse data. 
  
## Access the Snowmass21 Connect node

Information **here** describes:

1. How to obtain an account on the Snowmass21 Connect node
2. How to manage that account  
3. How to login to the resource

## Job Submissions to the OSG

Information **here** provides an introduction on how to submit jobs to the OSG from the Snowmass21 Connect node. Addittional software-specific examples are included in the [software](#Access-to-Software) section.

## Data Management on the Snowmass21 Connect node

Information **here** describes:

1. Storage locations available to the user
2. How to transfer files to and from the Snowmass21 Connect node
3. The methods of making files available on the Grid for jobs
                   
## Access to Software

Information **here** provides the means to access software from the Snowmass21 Connect node. Software includes common scientific packages and applications spefically installed in support of the the Snowmass21 effort. Provided also are the means to execute installed software either locally on the node or as part of a job submission to the OSG.

## Support and Consultation

The Snowmass21 Connect service is supported by the University of Chicago and the Open Science Grid. To report issues with the service or to request a consultation on submitting and running jobs on the OpenScienceG Grid please submit a ticket to <help@opensciencegrid.org>. Additional support is available in the **#snowmass-connect** channel at http://snowmass2021.slack.com.
