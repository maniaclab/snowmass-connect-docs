## General Purpose Tutorials

OSG provides a list of tutorials available as repositories on Github. These tutorials are designed for OSG submit nodes, are tested regularly and should work as is, but if you experience any issues please contact us. Users on the Snowmass login node should be able to run most of those. 

## Tutorial Commands

From the Snowmass Connect login node, the following tutorial commands are available:

    $ tutorial
    $ tutorial list
    $ tutorial info <tutorial-name>
    $ tutorial <tutorial-name>
